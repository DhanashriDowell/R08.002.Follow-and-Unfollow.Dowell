<LOGIC>
Start with queue of 45 thousand profiles and n identities 
Assign 1st n profiles to n identities 
After some time check which identity have completed its task (following assigned profile) and then assign next profile in queue to that identity
Repeat step 4 till all profiles get followed
Do whole procedure 10 times under the constrain that one profile should come to one identity only at once to get 10 different followers to all profiles
